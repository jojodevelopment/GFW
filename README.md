While traveling in China,  one of problem for people is Internet Usage. 
As we all known,  majority of websites and Apps are blocked in China, due to internet censorship in this country.
something like, WhatsApp / Google / Facebook / Youtube / social media / news portal,  etc. 

The block measure is called Internet Great Firewall (GFW).

It is pretty inconvenient for people,  who need to travel or work in China for a while ,  and still want to keep contact with outside.

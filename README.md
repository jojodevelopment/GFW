something like, WhatsApp / Google / Facebook / Youtube / social media / news portal,  etc. 

The block measure is called Internet Great Firewall (GFW).

It is pretty inconvenient for people,  who need to travel or work in China for a while ,  and still want to keep contact with outside.

All VPNs are using same mechanics.  It resulted in being detected easily by GFW.

so since 2020,  basically all VPNs have been banned completely in China.

A technology using VMess internet protocol is currently efficient way to get around the GFW.

It can break through the Internet block , compared to VPN.
Due to complex protocol between server , internet and own browser ,  it may have some response delay ,
